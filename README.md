# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Resources
Here you can find model examples and exercises from different sources with documentation created by me. Most of the files in the repo will be in `.ipynb` format.

### Getting started
1. You will need Anaconda
    - [Installation Guide](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
    - [Basic Commands](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html)
    - [Managing Evironments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)

>[!TIP]
> If you encounter any issues with conda, you can also use pip.

2. You will need to install and activate the environments saved in the `.yml` files:
    - `myenv.yml` contains the environment with the necessary packages for the examples and exercises in this repo. It will be updated from time to time as needed.
    - `ML.yml` is the environment that contains **all** the packages we will be working with (probably). We will be using it for more specific or complex problems.

3. You may need the Jupyter Notebook extension for Visual Studio Code:
